The shirt may also help prevent injuries when you do gym activities or other physical activities. How can the shirt do that? The shirt is anatomically constructed with NeuroBands™, which is tension panel bands that activates and stimulate specific muscle groups and joints to help improve your posture. This controlled resistance causes your muscles to contract to increase strength and keep you in an upright position. For those suffering from a shoulder injury or have recently had surgery, we recommend the zipper version of our Posture Shirt. We also have a wide selection of other <a href=\"\/collections\/back-support\"><u>products that provide back support<\/u><\/a>, including three different posture braces and a lumbar support belt. What these products have in common are posture correction and pain relief.",

In a corset or<br\/>compression shirt, you will get the feeling of “collapsing” once you take the product off. The idea behind is to hold you in a fixed position, making it very difficult for you to move. A medical specialist may recommend these types of product in very unique cases, but they would generally never recommend it if you are looking to achieve a better posture and reduce shoulder and back pain related to poor posture.<\/p><p>Posture correcting clothing from ActivePosture works differently from corsets by allowing you to retain free movement. The shirt is rather making you aware of your posture, see it as a strict teacher constantly telling you when your posture is poor. The Posture Shirt or InterActive Bra doesn’t feel comfortable like a normal t-shirt and bra. If you, for instance, are slouching you will feel the feedback from the shirt that will encourage you to align your posture and it will come naturally to you to do so. When you start aligning your posture, you will activate the muscles yourself. When you continuously activate your muscles, the muscles also build up muscle memory, so the effect is also seen when you are not wearing the shirt or bra.<\/p><p>In short: ActivePosture's products stimulate and activate the muscles instead of making<br\/>the muscles lazy and hereby weakening them.<\/p>"

If you experience fatigue within the first couple of hours, then take it off for that day and try it again the next day. For some,<br\/>it may work best starting with half an hour and then slowly building it up, while others can wear it for two hours from day 1. As you will be activating<br\/>muscles that may otherwise have been inactive for a long time (or just been used incorrectly) getting slight sore muscles may be the result in week one, but think of that as something good. It means your muscles are working.<\/p><p>If you do not experience any muscle pain, even on day 1, and you definitely have the right<br\/>size, then see how it goes if you wear it for 4 hours. If you wake up the next morning and feel you have very sore muscles, then take a break that day and<br\/>start up again the next day, maybe for a slightly shorter time.<\/p><p>After the first week, your muscles will have gotten used to being activated and you can wear the shirt for a longer time. Most people will begin to wear it for a full work day. As you start to wear it for such long periods at a time, you are quickly<br\/>building muscle memory, which means you will align your posture yourself, even when not wearing the shirt. Once you feel that you are aligning your posture even at times when not wearing the shirt, you can reduce the usage of the shirt to 3-4 times a week.<\/p><p>Below we have made a plan for the typical first-time user of a posture correcting shirt with regular posture issues due to slouching:<\/p><p><strong>Week 1<\/strong><br\/>Day 1-3: Wear it for 1-2 hours (if you don’t feel any soreness after day 1, then double the amount of time wearing it).<\/p><p>Day 4-7: Wear it for 2 hours daily (if you don’t feel any soreness then double the amount if hours using it).<\/p><p>Day 8 and onwards: Wear it for 8-10 hours a day 3-4 times a week. If you feel overtrained in your muscles from wearing it, then reduce the hours, for instance to 4-6 hours and<br\/>the slowly build it up to 8-10 hours.<\/p><p>If you get in doubt about what is best for you, then don’t hesitate to contact us and we will be<br\/>happy to give you some advice.<\/p>"
